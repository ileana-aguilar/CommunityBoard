**Goals**
[x] Initialize a new React application with Vite

[x] Create a functional React component

[x] Define and pass props to components

[x] Apply CSS styling to React components

**Required Features**
[x] Create a unique theme for events or resources relevant to a specific community

[x] Display at least 10 unique resources or events in a responsive card format

# Getting started
**Install dependencies**
```
npm install
```

**Run the application in developer mode**

```
npm run dev
```

**Open project in the browser**

In the command line Vite will display a link, such as http://127.0.0.1:5173 to click on or copy/paste that will take you to the localhost port where the project is running.


**Tip:** If you'd like to stop the server, you can use ctrl + c or cmd + c within the Terminal, or use the trash can icon in the top right of the Terminal within VS Code. To run the server again, simply use npm run dev again.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
